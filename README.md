## About Pole Balancer
Pole Balancer is a program that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design a policy for a controls problem. Through Markov decision processes framwork, we can perform reinforcement learning without having any explicit knowledge of the physics of the underlying system, in our case, the pole and on the cart.
