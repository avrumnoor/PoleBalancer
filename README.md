## About Pole Balancer
Pole Balancer is a Python program that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design a policy for the classic controls problem of a cart balancing a pole. Through Markov decision processes framework, we can perform reinforcement learning without having any explicit knowledge of the physics of the underlying system, in our case, the pole on the cart.

## Model
A thin pole is hinged to a cart. The cart moves laterally on a smooth table surface. The program fails if either the angle of the pole deviates by more than a particular amount from the vertical position (i.e., if the pole falls over), or if the cartâ€™s position goes out of bounds (i.e., if it falls off the end of the table).

## Program Objective
Balance the pole with these constraints, by appropriately having the cart accelerate left and right.
