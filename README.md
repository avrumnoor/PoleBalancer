# Pole Balancer

## About Pole Balancer
Pole Balancer is a Python program that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design a policy for the classic controls problem of a cart balancing a pole. Through Markov decision processes framwork, we can perform reinforcement learning without having any explicit knowledge of the physics of the underlying system, in our case, the pole and on the cart.
